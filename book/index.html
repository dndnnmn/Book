                    <h1>Chapter 1 ( A Gathering ) </h1>
                    <p> As i've read this Chapter it really made things interesting because it sets up the
                        whole story of the book, i've also notice how it's trying to portray the harsh social and
                        political climate of Spanish rule in the Philippines. It shows how the ones who are above
                        (colonial officals) are the ones who has power. But Ibarra symbolizes progress and bravery as he
                        remained calm throughout the scene.

                    <h1>Chapter 2 (Crisostomo Ibarra)</h1>
                    <p> This Chapter has even made more interested in reading the book, it sets up the character of
                        Ibarra being unbothered about any bad energy from others, especially Padre Damaso. Instead he
                        was more focused with reconnecting with his fellow people. This chapter made me want to know
                        more about Ibarra.</p>

                    <p>This chapter really pulled me in. Ibarras energy is just something else here hes so unaffected by
                        all the drama and, honestly, Padre Damasos shade doesnt even faze him. Instead of getting riled
                        up, hes all about reconnecting with everyone. Its like hes there to catch up, not to clash. This
                        chapter just makes me want to dig deeper into what Ibarras all about.</p>

                    <h1>Chapter 4 (Heretic and Subversive)</h1>
                    <p> This Chapter was intense, because those who were at higher positions view Ibarras action as
                        dangerous even tho he just wants to make the society better by building schools and etc. This
                        shows that people that wants to reform society are viewed as dangerous peoples by those people
                        that manages the traditional systems.</p>

                    <p> This Chapter amazed me because Ibarra faces a lot of problems, he really wanted to make change
                        for the good of society but is held back by people who is deeply rooted in tradition and
                        corruption. It shows Ibarra as a star in the midst of darkness and corrupt system. It's like a
                        star trying to shed light to it's power but then darkness is just too powerful.</p>

                        he is also associated with the church and local government. Capitan Tiago's character shows how
                        power and money can blur the lines between right and wrong, and how people use their resources
                        to manipulate their way into society's good graces.</p>

                        in the educational system and the challenges faced by those who wish to bring reform. It really
                        made me reflect on how education can either reinforce or challenge societal norms. It made me
                        realize how education shapes our thinking and can either hold on to tradition or push for

                        importance to the community. The character of the Cigar Maker made me think about how laborers
                        are often overlooked despite their crucial role in society. It reminded me that every job is
                        important, and the working class often goes unnoticed.</p>

                        rule. It reveals the hypocrisy and corruption hidden behind the facade of piety. It made me
                        think about how power and religion are sometimes used to manipulate people for selfish purposes.
